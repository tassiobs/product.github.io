When building a tech product, one size does not fit all. The approach you take can vary considerably depending on whether you're developing a customer-facing product or an internal platform product. While both follow product management fundamentals, they differ in audience, priorities, execution, and measurement of success.

To make this distinction clearer, I'm sharing this side-by-side checklist comparing the two. This visual can help teams align on the right focus areas depending on the type of product they're building—whether it's aimed at end users or internal stakeholders like developers and ops teams.

Check it out below.
